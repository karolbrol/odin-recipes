    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Guys, have you made spaghetti aglio e olio before?
    </p>
    <p>
        Barclay and I saw this classic pasta dish on menus everywhere during our trip to Rome and Naples a few years ago,
        and have enjoyed perfecting our version of it at home ever since.
        It’s ultra-easy to make with just four ingredients — garlic (aglio), olive oil (olio), spaghetti,
        and a hint of red chile peppers. But while Italians typically use chopped fresh red chiles (peperoncini)
        in this dish, fresh red chile peppers can be a bit harder to find here in Spain and elsewhere around the world.
        So we typically just use a generous pinch of crushed red pepper flakes from our pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, I learned on our trip to Italy that I had actually been making this dish wrong in years past,
        when I used to just toss spaghetti in the garlicky oil once it had finished cooking. The key to creating
        a gorgeous, glossy, non-greasy sauce is to create an emulsion with the garlicky oil and that magical
        starchy pasta water (the key to most good pasta sauces!). All you have to do transfer the pasta and
        a half-ish cup of that hot starchy pasta water directly into the pan of garlicky oil one minute before
        the pasta is done cooking. Then while you toss the pasta, all of that heat and starch will help the
        garlic oil emulsify into a beautiful glossy sauce, while the pasta soaks up some extra garlicky flavors
        as it finishes cooking.
    </p>

        It’s a simple tweak that’s guaranteed to kick your aglio e olio up a delicious notch,
        and it could not be easier. So grab some garlic and olive oil, and let’s make this classic pasta dish together!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Spaghetti:</strong> Or linguine, fettuccine, or any other shape of pasta noodle you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Olive oil:</strong> Since olive oil is the main ingredient in this sauce, I really recommend using
            the best-quality extra virgin olive oil you can find. It will make a difference!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Garlic:</strong> I admittedly like tons of garlic in this pasta (like, closer to 10-12 cloves).
            But it is traditionally made with between 4-8 cloves. So you do what sounds best to you!

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Crushed red pepper flakes:</strong> Traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is made with fresh peperoncini
            (red hot chile peppers) that are commonly found throughout Italy. But since they are harder
            to find in other countries, I have written this recipe using dried crushed red pepper flakes,
            which we will simmer in the olive oil to bring out their best flavor.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the spaghetti.</strong> Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water
            until it is just one minute shy of being al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sauté the garlic.</strong>  Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water,
            heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed
            red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Toss the pasta in the sauce.</strong>  Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer
            the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water.
            Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry,
            add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Taste and season.</strong> Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve.</strong> Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.
        </li>
    </ol>
