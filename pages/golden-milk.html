    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re craving a cozy mug of warm golden milk on a chilly day, or looking to cool off with a refreshing glass of iced golden milk, my favorite golden milk recipe always hits the spot. ♡</p>
        <p>It’s quick and easy to make with a simple blend of warming spices that you likely already have in your pantry, including nutrient-dense turmeric, which gives the drink is famously bright and beautiful golden color. And when making homemade golden milk, you of course have the option to completely customize the spice blend, type of milk, and amount of sweetener to your liking. If you enjoy golden milk on the regular like we do in our home, I’ve also included instructions below for how to pre-mix a large batch of golden milk powder (basically all of the spices, salt and pepper) ahead of time, so that you can just add a quick spoonful to steamed milk whenever the craving hits. And while we normally only keep ground turmeric stocked in our kitchen, I’ve included an option as well for how to make golden milk with fresh turmeric if you happen to have some on hand.</p>
        <p>I’ve been in the habit this winter of making myself a warm mug of golden milk each evening after dinner, and have to say that I find myself looking forward to that soothing, delicious blend of warming spices so much. It’s just such a delicious drink, in addition to its impressive list of healing benefits (see below), and never fails to deliver on those comforting hygge vibes.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>Milk:</strong> I typically use plain oat milk (or a 50/50 blend of oat milk and water) to make a golden milk latte, but any variety of dairy milk or plant-based plain milk will do.</p>
        <p><strong>Sweetener:</strong> You’re welcome to add in a drizzle of maple syrup, honey, sugar or your preferred sweetener to sweeten this drink.</p>
        <p><strong>Warming spices:</strong> I love using a simple mix of ground turmeric, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, black pepper (essential to help the body better absorb the nutrients in turmeric) and fine sea salt for my golden milk powder base. But of course, please feel free to customize your own blend and add in any other warming spices that you love too, such as cardamom, nutmeg, allspice or cloves.</p>
        <p><strong>Vanilla extract:</strong> A splash of vanilla is optional but really brings out the best of these warming spices.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Dissolve the spices.</strong> Whether you’re making hot or iced golden milk, it’s essential to first dissolve the spices and salt in hot milk. So heat the milk — the full amount of milk for the hot version, or a small amount of milk for the iced version — until it nearly reaches a simmer. (You do not want the milk to boil.) Then stir in the spices, salt, vanilla extract, and any additional sweetener until dissolved.</p>
        <p><strong>Add cold milk (only if serving iced).</strong> At this point, pour the hot golden milk base over a full glass of ice and stir with cold milk until combined if you are making iced golden milk.</p>
        <p><strong>Taste.</strong> Give the hot or iced golden milk a taste and see if you need to stir in any additional sweetener.</p>
        <p><strong>Serve.</strong> Then serve and enjoy! The spices in golden milk can have a tendency to sink to the bottom after a little while, so I recommend regularly giving your drink a stir to mix it up.</p>
