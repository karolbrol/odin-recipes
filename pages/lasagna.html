    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I’m officially declaring this Italian Week here on the blog!</p>
    <p>Yep. Get ready to do some seriously delicious recipe bookmarking this week, because I’m going to be sharing some of my all-time favorite recipes for a few of the classics, beginning today with…</p>
    <p>…this life-changing lasagna recipe. ♡</p>
    <p>So here’s the thing. For years and years, I always admittedly tended to avoid making homemade lasagna in favor of other quicker and easier pasta recipes because — well, frankly — none of the homemade lasagna recipes that I tried seemed to be worth all of the effort! As Barclay would say, they were always just kind of “whelming” — not overwhelming, not underwhelming, not particularly memorable, and definitely not worth all of the prep time. And you know me, if I’m going to invest more than 30 minutes in a recipe, it had better knock my freaking socks off.</p>
    <p>Well, our trip to Italy this spring convinced me that seriously good lasagna could indeed be worth the extra effort. So once we arrived home from Amalfi, I set to work on a mega lasagna recipe testing spree. And today — many many batches later — I’m happy to report that I have finally landed on a classic lasagna recipe that I legit love.</p>
    <p>You guys, this lasagna recipe is simply THE BEST.</p>
    <p>Mainly, I’m convinced it is the best because it is so dang flavorful. It’s made with a rich, complex and deeply delicious meat marinara sauce, which is slow simmered with zesty Italian sausage (way more flavor than ground beef), easy canned tomatoes, a few special veggies, dry red wine, and lots of herbs. It also includes three different cheeses (because lasagna), easy no-boil lasagna noodles (to save us all from having to mess with boiling them), and lots and lots of fresh basil (baked into and sprinkled on top of the lasagna). The ingredient list isn’t complicated, but I’m telling you, all of these delicious layers are magic when baked together into a bubbly, melty, hot pan of lasagna. And 100% worth the effort.</p>
    <p>Speaking of effort, I also want to note that this recipe isn’t difficult at all to make technique-wise. It just requires a solid hour or so of prep time. So find an evening when you’re not in a rush, turn on some music, maybe pour yourself a glass of wine or some good fizzy water, and let’s make a pan of the most delicious lasagna together. I’m certain you’re going to love it.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Italian sausage:</strong> I’m a big believer that good-quality Italian sausage — with all of its rich, herby, zesty flavors — is the key to a stellar pan of classic lasagna. So buy a good one! That said, if you really prefer to add in some ground beef, you are welcome to do a 50/50 split.</li>
        <li><strong>Veggies:</strong> We will chop up an onion and lots of garlic for our sauce. Plus you will also need 1/2 cup (about half a regular-sized jar) of diced roasted red peppers, which will add some nice smoky and sweet hints to the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes + tomato paste:</strong> Three cans of good-quality whole tomatoes — I especially recommend the fire-roasted variety if you can find them — plus a few tablespoons of tomato paste. The quality of your tomatoes will really make a difference here, so it’s worth the extra few dollars to splurge on some go</li>
        <li><strong>Dry red wine:</strong> Which will add the yummiest depth of flavor to our sauce. Or if you prefer not to cook with wine, you are welcome to sub in beef, chicken or vegetable stock instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Dried herbs + spices:</strong> Crushed red pepper flakes, dried oregano, bay leaf, sea salt and lots of freshly-cracked black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh basil:</strong> When it comes to fresh basil, I vote the more the merrier with this lasagna recipe. We will chop and stir a good amount of basil into the cheese mixture. But then I also recommend adding extra on top as a garnish.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Lots of ricotta (you can use either whole milk or part-skim ricotta), Parmesan (freshly-grated for maximum flavor!), and shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> This will help to bind the cheese mixture to the noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Finally, noodles! I much prefer the ease and texture of the no-boil noodles for this lasagna recipe. But if you purchase the classic noodles, just let them soak in hot water for about 30 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients, before layering them into the lasagna.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Follow the sauce instructions and then let it simmer until the liquid has reduced about by half. You want the sauce to still be a bit juicy (so that it will cook the noodles), but not super liquidy. Meanwhile…</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese mixture:</strong> Stir together the ricotta, Parmesan, basil and egg until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep oven and baking dish:</strong> Heat the oven to 375°F and mist a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> In this order:
            <ol>
                <li>First layer: Sauce + noodles + ricotta + mozzarella</li>
                <li>Second layer: Sauce + noodles + ricotta + mozzarella</li>
                <li>Third layer: Sauce + noodles + ricotta</li>
                <li>Fourth layer: Sauce + mozzarella</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Loosely tent aluminum foil to cover the pan (try to avoid touching the cheese). Bake for 45 minutes covered, followed by another 15-20 minutes uncovered, until the cheese is melty and golden. Transfer pan to a wire baking rack to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Sprinkle on your desired toppings, slice, serve warm, and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
